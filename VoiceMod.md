# Voice Mod

## Overview
The **Voice Mod** node applies audio processing techniques to modify and transform voice characteristics. It is designed to alter the input audio signal by adjusting aspects such as pitch, timbre, and spectral content, making it ideal for creative sound design, vocal effects, and other audio transformation tasks.

## How It Works
- The node receives an audio input and processes it using various digital signal processing techniques.
- Depending on its implementation, transformations may include pitch shifting, spectral morphing, filtering, and other modulation effects.
- The result is an audio output with a modified voice quality that can exhibit creative or dramatic changes compared to the original signal.

## Parameters
- **audio** (AUDIO):  
  The input audio signal to be modified. The node processes this signal to apply the desired voice transformations.
  
- Additional parameters may be available (such as controls for pitch shift amount, modulation depth, or frequency filtering) depending on the specific algorithm used within the node. These parameters allow fine-tuned adjustments to achieve the desired vocal effect.

## Return Value
- **AUDIO**:  
  The transformed audio output with modified voice characteristics. This output can be routed to further processing nodes or playback systems.
